## Development

### Getting started

Clone the package into the project root.

```
git clone https://github.com/itsjeffro/deploy.git
```

#### Composer dependencies

Add the following to your main Laravel project's composer.json and then run `composer require itsjeffro/deploy`.

```json
{
    "repositories": [ 
        {
            "type": "path",
            "url": "deploy",
            "options": {
                "symlink": true
            }
        } 
    ]
}
```

#### NPM dependencies

Run `npm install` to install any frontend dependencies.

### Working on the Frontend

Compiled assets will be automatically copied over to the main project's public directory as `vendor/deploy`. If it does not, then you may not have cloned the package to the correct path in your project.

#### Compiling assets

While working on the frontend related files, you may run `npm run watch`.

Prior to pushing changes to the repository, you must run `npm run prod` so that everything is minified etc.

### Working on the API
