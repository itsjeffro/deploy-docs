# Deployment

## Getting started

Before you can start deploying your code, the following must be done:

* Create a server from your project's dashboard
* Copy the created server's generated ssh public key to your actual server

### Manual deployment

From your project's dashboard, you may click the `Deploy` button. This will display a prompt where you may specify the branch, commit or tag from your repository you wish to deploy.

Click `Deploy` to confirm and start your deployment.

### Automatic deployments

On the project's dashboard page, you may have noticed `Deploy on push`.

`Deploy on push` indicates if deployments are initiated during every push to your repository.

This can be enabled from your project's settings page.
